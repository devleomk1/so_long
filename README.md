This is a small game project from 42school implemented using MiniLibX. The project is inspired by Game Freak's Pokemon Firered.

## Goals
This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

## Getting Started
```
🚨 Please check the issue/#1 before start.
```
### Install

$ make bonus
```

### Usage
```bash
$ ./so_long_bonus [MAP_FILE.ber]
```
Only map files with extension `.ber` are available. Map file examples are available in the `map/` directory.
